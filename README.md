# Who's That Pokémon?

This project encompasses a simple webpage which you can use to play the classic Who's that Pokémon game from the original anime series. Currently, the game keeps track of your score until you refresh the webpage and includes Pokémon #1 through Pokémon #1025. A silhouette will be shown and you can guess the pokemon based either on the silhouette or first reveal the image.

    - set predefined ranges and randomly choose between those ranges with a formula weighted by generation size

- Introduce scoring to keep track of answers using silhouettes vs. revealed images
- Introduce hints that can be used which might include
    - Type of pokemon
    - Regional Pokedex to which they pertain
