# Who's That Pokémon?

This project encompasses a simple webpage which you can use to play the classic Who's that Pokémon game from the original anime series. Currently, the game keeps track of your score until you refresh the webpage and includes Pokémon #1 through Pokémon #1025. A silhouette will be shown and you can guess the pokemon based either on the silhouette or first reveal the image.

## Planned changes

- Allow users to specify a generation cut-off point
    - Allow users to mix and match non sequential gens
    - i.e. Generations 1, 2, 5, 7, 9

- Introduce scoring to keep track of answers using silhouettes vs. revealed images
